Remember that to users, buttons and links look the same in most cases.\n  If the action is completely unrelated to a potential action to be taken on the page, return an empty array. \n  ONLY return one action. If multiple actions are relevant, return the most relevant one. \n  If the user is asking to scroll to a position on the page, e.g., 'halfway' or 0.75, etc, you must return the argument formatted as the correct percentage, e.g., '50%' or '75%', etc.\n  If the user is asking to scroll to the next chunk/previous chunk, choose the nextChunk/prevChunk method. No arguments are required here.\n  If the action implies a key press, e.g., 'press enter', 'press a', 'press space', etc., always choose the press method with the appropriate key as argument — e.g. 'a', 'Enter', 'Space'. Do not choose a click action on an on-screen keyboard. Capitalize the first character like 'Enter', 'Tab', 'Escape' only for special keys.\n  If the action implies choosing an option from a dropdown, AND the corresponding element is a 'select' element, choose the selectOptionFromDropdown method. The argument should be the text of the option to select.\n  If the action implies choosing an option from a dropdown, and the corresponding element is NOT a 'select' element, choose the click method."

The argument should be the text of the option to select.\n  If the action implies choosing an option from a dropdown, and the corresponding element is NOT a 'select' element, choose the click method.\nAccessibility Tree: \n[0-2] RootWebArea: Hacker News\n  [0-30] scrollable\n    [0-41] LayoutTable\n      [0-42] tbody\n        [0-43] LayoutTableRow\n          [0-44] LayoutTableCell: Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login\n            [0-45] LayoutTable\n              [0-47] LayoutTableRow\n                [0-48] LayoutTableCell\n                  [0-49] link\n                    [0-6] image\n                [0-50] LayoutTableCell: Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit\n                  [0-53] link: Hacker News\n                  [0-55] link: new\n                  [0-57] StaticText: |\n                  [0-58] link: past\n                  [0-60] StaticText: |\n                  [0-61] link: comments\n                  [0-63] StaticText: |\n                  [0-64] link: ask\n                  [0-66] StaticText: |\n                  [0-67] link: show\n                  [0-69] StaticText: |\n                  [0-70] link: jobs\n                  [0-72] StaticText: |\n                  [0-73] link: submit\n                [0-75] LayoutTableCell: login\n                  [0-77] link: login\n        [0-79] LayoutTableRow\n        [0-80] LayoutTableRow\n          [0-81] LayoutTableCell\n            [0-82] table\n              [0-83] tbody\n                [0-84] row\n                  [0-85] cell: 1.\n                  [0-88] cell\n                    [0-90] link\n                  [0-91] cell: Bypassing Google's big anti-adblock update (0x44.xyz)\n                    [0-93] link: Bypassing Google's big anti-adblock update\n                    [0-96] StaticText: (\n                    [0-97] link: 0x44.xyz\n                    [0-100] StaticText: )\n                [0-101] row\n                  [0-102] cell\n                  [0-103] cell: 411 points by deryilz 6 hours ago | hide | 349 comments\n                    [0-106] StaticText: 411 points\n                    [0-107] StaticText: by\n                    [0-108] link: deryilz\n                    [1252] StaticText: \n                    [0-111] link: 6 hours ago\n                    [1253] StaticText: \n                    [0-114] StaticText: |\n                    [0-115] link: hide\n                    [0-117] StaticText: |\n                    [0-118] link: 349 comments\n                [0-120] row\n                [0-121] row\n                  [0-122] cell: 2.\n                  [0-125] cell\n                    [0-127] link\n                  [0-128] cell: Hacking Coroutines into C (wiomoc.de)\n                    [0-130] link: Hacking Coroutines into C\n                    [0-133] StaticText: (\n                    [0-134] link: wiomoc.de\n                    [0-137] StaticText: )\n                [0-138] row\n                  [0-139] cell\n                  [0-140] cell: 20 points by jmillikin 52 minutes ago | hide | 4 comments\n                    [0-143] StaticText: 20 points\n                    [0-144] StaticText: by\n                    [0-145] link: jmillikin\n                    [1254] StaticText: \n                    [0-148] link: 52 minutes ago\n                    [1255] StaticText: \n                    [0-151] StaticText: |\n                    [0-152] link: hide\n                    [0-154] StaticText: |\n                    [0-155] link: 4 comments\n                [0-157] row\n                [0-158] row\n                  [0-159] cell: 3.\n                  [0-162] cell\n                    [0-164] link\n                  [0-165] cell: Kimi k2 largest open source SOTA model?

You've probably also heard that this hurts adblockers.\n        [0-33] paragraph\n          [0-34] StaticText: A quick explainer: \"MV\" stands for \"manifest version.\" MV3 introduces a new type of runtime for Chrome extensions that, among other things, gets rid of\n          [0-35] code\n            [0-36] StaticText: webRequestBlocking\n          [0-37] StaticText: , a permission that allows extensions to block requests dynamically based on their content (which\n          [0-38] link: its replacement\n          [0-40] StaticText: does not support). Adblockers heavily rely on\n          [0-41] code\n            [0-42] StaticText: webRequestBlocking\n          [0-43] StaticText: to function properly. Pretty convenient (cough cough) for a company that makes most of its revenue from ads to be removing that.\n        [0-44] paragraph\n          [0-45] StaticText: Anyway, with the phasing-out of MV2 pretty much done, now seems like a good time to talk about a bug in Chrome that I found and reported to Google in 2023.\n          [0-46] link: The bug\n          [0-48] StaticText: let\n          [0-49] code\n            [0-50] StaticText: webRequestBlocking\n          [0-51] StaticText: (and yes, adblockers) work in MV3.\n        [0-52] paragraph\n          [0-53] StaticText: I still consider it probably the funniest bug I've ever found.\n        [0-54] heading: Stop writing browsers in JavaScript\n        [0-56] paragraph\n          [0-57] StaticText: Yes, Chrome is written in C++. However, extensions are written in JavaScript, and the API functions they call look just like JavaScript functions, at least from the extension's point of view. But they aren't normal functions: they're special and do browsery C++ stuff through bindings. In theory, this should be safe.\n        [0-58] paragraph\n          [0-59] StaticText: But in the old days, Google decided it'd be a good idea to inject a bunch of JS files into pages that used Chrome APIs. These \"extension binding modules\" would initialize API functions and validate arguments before passing them to the browser.\n        [0-60] paragraph\n          [0-61] StaticText: (Note:\n          [0-62] link: here's the codebase\n          [0-64] StaticText: of those files in 2016.)\n        [0-65] paragraph\n          [0-66] StaticText: Turns out running privileged JavaScript in user-controlled websites was not a good idea, because JS can often be manipulated by overriding global functions and prototypes. Since certain APIs like\n          [0-67] code\n            [0-68] StaticText: chrome.runtime\n          [0-69] StaticText: exist on normal websites too, the extension bindings system led to multiple Universal XSS bugs back in 2015 and 2016.\n          [0-70] link: Here's one\n          [0-72] StaticText: that allows any website to inject code into any other website. Truly crazy stuff. If only I weren't 8 years old back then... maybe I could have cashed in.\n        [0-73] paragraph\n          [0-74] StaticText: Anyway, Google learned from their mistake and moved most API bindings to pure C++. However, a couple of JS binding files still exist and are used today. For example, if a Chrome extension runs the following code, it'll hit a\n          [0-75] link: JS loop\n          [0-77] StaticText: and hang infinitely: (as of July 2025)\n        [0-79] code\n          [0-80] StaticText: chrome.permissions.contains({ permissions: { length: Infinity }})\n        [0-81] paragraph\n          [0-82] StaticText: Maybe you are wondering what this has to do with adblockers.\n        [0-83] paragraph\n          [0-84] StaticText: Remember how I said only a few APIs still use JavaScript bindings?\n          [0-85] code\n            [0-86] StaticText: chrome.webRequest\n          [0-87] StaticText: is one of them.\n        [0-88] heading: The bug\n        [0-90] paragraph\n          [0-91] StaticText: This is how an MV2 extension would block requests to example.com:\n        [0-93] code\n          [0-94] StaticText: chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(() => {  \n    return { cancel: true }  \n}, { urls: ['*://*.example.com/*'] }, ['blocking'])\n        [0-95] paragraph\n          [0-96] StaticText: It's the\n          [0-97] code\n            [0-98] StaticText: 'blocking'\n          [0-99] StaticText: part at the end that requires the\n          [0-100] code\n            [0-101] StaticText: webRequestBlocking\n          [0-102] StaticText: permission, and therefore isn't allowed in MV3. Without it, the\n          [0-103] code\n            [0-104] StaticText: cancel: true\n          [0-105] StaticText: does nothing.\n        [0-106] paragraph\n          [0-107] StaticText: So clearly adding a blocking listener to the\n          [0-108] code\n            [0-109] StaticText: chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest\n          [0-110] StaticText: event does not work anymore. But we can do something crazy. We can make\n          [0-111] strong\n            [0-112] StaticText: our own event.\n          [0-113] StaticText: Now, this should not be possible; it's not even a concept that makes sense. But, because of how the JS bindings work, you can do it. For some reason, there is a\n          [0-114] link: wrapper class\n          [0-116] StaticText: for\n          [0-117] code\n            [0-118] StaticText: webRequest\n          [0-119] StaticText: events that contains some extra state.\n        [0-120] paragraph\n        [0-122] paragraph\n          [0-123] StaticText: (A\n          [0-124] link: note on the security\n          [0-126] StaticText: of the above code.)\n        [0-127] paragraph\n          [0-128] StaticText: Instead of doing pure bindings between JS and C++, the browser creates one of these classes for every\n          [0-129] code\n            [0-130] StaticText: chrome.webRequest\n          [0-131] StaticText: event:\n          [0-132] code\n            [0-133] StaticText: onBeforeRequest\n          [0-134] StaticText: ,\n          [0-135] code\n            [0-136] StaticText: onCompleted\n          [0-137] StaticText: , etc. Surprisingly, the\n          [0-138] code\n            [0-139] StaticText: .constructor\n          [0-140] StaticText: of these events is still public. It points to yet another wrapper class, which internally calls\n          [0-141] code\n            [0-142] StaticText: WebRequestEventImpl\n          [0-143] StaticText: (from the code above). You can use this to can create a new event with your own properties:\n        [0-145] code\n          [0-146] StaticText: let WebRequestEvent = chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.constructor\nlet fooEvent = new WebRequestEvent(\"foo\")\n        [0-147] paragraph\n          [0-148] StaticText: There is still a lot of validation going on in the backend when you try to actually do things with these fake events. For example, trying to add a listener to\n          [0-149] code\n            [0-150] StaticText: fooEvent\n          [0-151] StaticText: kills the extension's process, because the event name is invalid. So how do you manipulate the properties of\n          [0-152] code\n            [0-153] StaticText: WebRequestEventImpl\n          [0-154] StaticText: to do anything interesting?\n        [0-155] paragraph\n          [0-156] StaticText: After a lot of time looking into the C++ code, I found exactly one vulnerable thing: the\n          [0-157] code\n            [0-158] StaticText: opt_webViewInstanceId\n          [0-159] StaticText: parameter. This was set for Chrome platform apps, in order to let them manage their embedded websites (WebViews). Among other things, it let them use web request blocking to control navigation. Basically, if an event had a WebView ID, the permission check for\n          [0-160] code\n            [0-161] StaticText: webRequestBlocking\n          [212] StaticText: \n          [0-162] link: would be skipped\n          [0-164] StaticText: . The issue was that the browser never verified that an event with a WebView ID actually belonged to a platform app. So an extension could spoof it, skip the check, and use the blocking feature.\n        [0-166] code\n          [0-167] StaticText: let WebRequestEvent = chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.constructor\n\n// opt_webViewInstanceId is the 5th argument\nlet fakeEvent = new WebRequestEvent(\"webRequest.onBeforeRequest\", 0, 0, 0, 1337)\n\nfakeEvent.addListener(() => {  \n    return { cancel: true }  \n}, { urls: ['*://*.example.com/*'] }, ['blocking'])\n        [0-168] paragraph\n          [0-169] StaticText: Maybe I should note that platform apps were\n          [0-170] strong\n            [0-171] StaticText: deprecated in 2020.\n          [0-172] StaticText: I found this bug in 2023, and the code to handle\n          [0-173] code\n            [0-174] StaticText: opt_webViewInstanceId\n          [0-175] StaticText: still exists in 2025. Goes to show how ancient code leads to bugs.\n        [0-176] heading: What could have happened, and what happened\n        [0-178] paragraph\n          [0-179] StaticText: Technically, someone could have used this bug to make a perfectly working adblocker in MV3 by simply replacing all instances of\n          [0-180] code\n            [0-181] StaticText: chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest\n          [0-182] StaticText: with\n          [0-183] code\n            [0-184] StaticText: fakeEvent\n          [0-185] StaticText: . This would have been very funny, after all the hype about how adblockers were being killed.\n        [0-186] paragraph\n          [0-187] StaticText: But I don't know how to make an adblocker, so I decided to\n          [0-188] link: report the issue to Google\n          [0-190] StaticText: in August 2023.

However, extensions are written in JavaScript, and the API functions they call look just like JavaScript functions, at least from the extension's point of view. But they aren't normal functions: they're special and do browsery C++ stuff through bindings. In theory, this should be safe.\n        [0-58] paragraph\n          [0-59] StaticText: But in the old days, Google decided it'd be a good idea to inject a bunch of JS files into pages that used Chrome APIs. These \"extension binding modules\" would initialize API functions and validate arguments before passing them to the browser.\n        [0-60] paragraph\n          [0-61] StaticText: (Note:\n          [0-62] link: here's the codebase\n          [0-64] StaticText: of those files in 2016.)\n        [0-65] paragraph\n          [0-66] StaticText: Turns out running privileged JavaScript in user-controlled websites was not a good idea, because JS can often be manipulated by overriding global functions and prototypes. Since certain APIs like\n          [0-67] code\n            [0-68] StaticText: chrome.runtime\n          [0-69] StaticText: exist on normal websites too, the extension bindings system led to multiple Universal XSS bugs back in 2015 and 2016.\n          [0-70] link: Here's one\n          [0-72] StaticText: that allows any website to inject code into any other website. Truly crazy stuff. If only I weren't 8 years old back then... maybe I could have cashed in.\n        [0-73] paragraph\n          [0-74] StaticText: Anyway, Google learned from their mistake and moved most API bindings to pure C++. However, a couple of JS binding files still exist and are used today. For example, if a Chrome extension runs the following code, it'll hit a\n          [0-75] link: JS loop\n          [0-77] StaticText: and hang infinitely: (as of July 2025)\n        [0-79] code\n          [0-80] StaticText: chrome.permissions.contains({ permissions: { length: Infinity }})\n        [0-81] paragraph\n          [0-82] StaticText: Maybe you are wondering what this has to do with adblockers.\n        [0-83] paragraph\n          [0-84] StaticText: Remember how I said only a few APIs still use JavaScript bindings?\n          [0-85] code\n            [0-86] StaticText: chrome.webRequest\n          [0-87] StaticText: is one of them.\n        [0-88] heading: The bug\n        [0-90] paragraph\n          [0-91] StaticText: This is how an MV2 extension would block requests to example.com:\n        [0-93] code\n          [0-94] StaticText: chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(() => {  \n    return { cancel: true }  \n}, { urls: ['*://*.example.com/*'] }, ['blocking'])\n        [0-95] paragraph\n          [0-96] StaticText: It's the\n          [0-97] code\n            [0-98] StaticText: 'blocking'\n          [0-99] StaticText: part at the end that requires the\n          [0-100] code\n            [0-101] StaticText: webRequestBlocking\n          [0-102] StaticText: permission, and therefore isn't allowed in MV3. Without it, the\n          [0-103] code\n            [0-104] StaticText: cancel: true\n          [0-105] StaticText: does nothing.\n        [0-106] paragraph\n          [0-107] StaticText: So clearly adding a blocking listener to the\n          [0-108] code\n            [0-109] StaticText: chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest\n          [0-110] StaticText: event does not work anymore. But we can do something crazy. We can make\n          [0-111] strong\n            [0-112] StaticText: our own event.\n          [0-113] StaticText: Now, this should not be possible; it's not even a concept that makes sense. But, because of how the JS bindings work, you can do it. For some reason, there is a\n          [0-114] link: wrapper class\n          [0-116] StaticText: for\n          [0-117] code\n            [0-118] StaticText: webRequest\n          [0-119] StaticText: events that contains some extra state.\n        [0-120] paragraph\n        [0-122] paragraph\n          [0-123] StaticText: (A\n          [0-124] link: note on the security\n          [0-126] StaticText: of the above code.)\n        [0-127] paragraph\n          [0-128] StaticText: Instead of doing pure bindings between JS and C++, the browser creates one of these classes for every\n          [0-129] code\n            [0-130] StaticText: chrome.webRequest\n          [0-131] StaticText: event:\n          [0-132] code\n            [0-133] StaticText: onBeforeRequest\n          [0-134] StaticText: ,\n          [0-135] code\n            [0-136] StaticText: onCompleted\n          [0-137] StaticText: , etc. Surprisingly, the\n          [0-138] code\n            [0-139] StaticText: .constructor\n          [0-140] StaticText: of these events is still public. It points to yet another wrapper class, which internally calls\n          [0-141] code\n            [0-142] StaticText: WebRequestEventImpl\n          [0-143] StaticText: (from the code above). You can use this to can create a new event with your own properties:\n        [0-145] code\n          [0-146] StaticText: let WebRequestEvent = chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.constructor\nlet fooEvent = new WebRequestEvent(\"foo\")\n        [0-147] paragraph\n          [0-148] StaticText: There is still a lot of validation going on in the backend when you try to actually do things with these fake events. For example, trying to add a listener to\n          [0-149] code\n            [0-150] StaticText: fooEvent\n          [0-151] StaticText: kills the extension's process, because the event name is invalid. So how do you manipulate the properties of\n          [0-152] code\n            [0-153] StaticText: WebRequestEventImpl\n          [0-154] StaticText: to do anything interesting?\n        [0-155] paragraph\n          [0-156] StaticText: After a lot of time looking into the C++ code, I found exactly one vulnerable thing: the\n          [0-157] code\n            [0-158] StaticText: opt_webViewInstanceId\n          [0-159] StaticText: parameter. This was set for Chrome platform apps, in order to let them manage their embedded websites (WebViews). Among other things, it let them use web request blocking to control navigation. Basically, if an event had a WebView ID, the permission check for\n          [0-160] code\n            [0-161] StaticText: webRequestBlocking\n          [212] StaticText: \n          [0-162] link: would be skipped\n          [0-164] StaticText: .

However, extensions are written in JavaScript, and the API functions they call look just like JavaScript functions, at least from the extension's point of view.

In theory, this should be safe.\n        [0-58] paragraph\n          [0-59] StaticText: But in the old days, Google decided it'd be a good idea to inject a bunch of JS files into pages that used Chrome APIs.

However, a couple of JS binding files still exist and are used today.

It points to yet another wrapper class, which internally calls\n          [0-141] code\n            [0-142] StaticText: WebRequestEventImpl\n          [0-143] StaticText: (from the code above). You can use this to can create a new event with your own properties:\n        [0-145] code\n          [0-146] StaticText: let WebRequestEvent = chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.constructor\nlet fooEvent = new WebRequestEvent(\"foo\")\n        [0-147] paragraph\n          [0-148] StaticText: There is still a lot of validation going on in the backend when you try to actually do things with these fake events. For example, trying to add a listener to\n          [0-149] code\n            [0-150] StaticText: fooEvent\n          [0-151] StaticText: kills the extension's process, because the event name is invalid. So how do you manipulate the properties of\n          [0-152] code\n            [0-153] StaticText: WebRequestEventImpl\n          [0-154] StaticText: to do anything interesting?\n        [0-155] paragraph\n          [0-156] StaticText: After a lot of time looking into the C++ code, I found exactly one vulnerable thing: the\n          [0-157] code\n            [0-158] StaticText: opt_webViewInstanceId\n          [0-159] StaticText: parameter. This was set for Chrome platform apps, in order to let them manage their embedded websites (WebViews). Among other things, it let them use web request blocking to control navigation. Basically, if an event had a WebView ID, the permission check for\n          [0-160] code\n            [0-161] StaticText: webRequestBlocking\n          [212] StaticText: \n          [0-162] link: would be skipped\n          [0-164] StaticText: . The issue was that the browser never verified that an event with a WebView ID actually belonged to a platform app. So an extension could spoof it, skip the check, and use the blocking feature.\n        [0-166] code\n          [0-167] StaticText: let WebRequestEvent = chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.constructor\n\n// opt_webViewInstanceId is the 5th argument\nlet fakeEvent = new WebRequestEvent(\"webRequest.onBeforeRequest\", 0, 0, 0, 1337)\n\nfakeEvent.addListener(() => {  \n    return { cancel: true }  \n}, { urls: ['*://*.example.com/*'] }, ['blocking'])\n        [0-168] paragraph\n          [0-169] StaticText: Maybe I should note that platform apps were\n          [0-170] strong\n            [0-171] StaticText: deprecated in 2020.\n          [0-172] StaticText: I found this bug in 2023, and the code to handle\n          [0-173] code\n            [0-174] StaticText: opt_webViewInstanceId\n          [0-175] StaticText: still exists in 2025. Goes to show how ancient code leads to bugs.\n        [0-176] heading: What could have happened, and what happened\n        [0-178] paragraph\n          [0-179] StaticText: Technically, someone could have used this bug to make a perfectly working adblocker in MV3 by simply replacing all instances of\n          [0-180] code\n            [0-181] StaticText: chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest\n          [0-182] StaticText: with\n          [0-183] code\n            [0-184] StaticText: fakeEvent\n          [0-185] StaticText: . This would have been very funny, after all the hype about how adblockers were being killed.\n        [0-186] paragraph\n          [0-187] StaticText: But I don't know how to make an adblocker, so I decided to\n          [0-188] link: report the issue to Google\n          [0-190] StaticText: in August 2023. It was patched in Chrome 118 by\n          [0-191] link: checking whether\n          [0-193] StaticText: extensions using\n          [0-194] code\n            [0-195] StaticText: opt_webViewInstanceId\n          [0-196] StaticText: actually had WebView permissions. For the report, I netted a massive reward of $0. They decided it wasn't a security issue, and honestly, I agree, because it didn't give extensions access to data they didn't already have.\n        [0-197] paragraph\n          [0-198] image: No money\n        [0-199] paragraph\n          [0-200] StaticText: (Shown above: my earnings from this bug.)\n        [0-201] paragraph\n          [0-202] StaticText: Anyway, it was a fun one, and it really shows how a few lines of code can sometimes bypass a big update by a big company.

You've probably also heard that this hurts adblockers.\n        [0-33] paragraph\n          [0-34] StaticText: A quick explainer: \"MV\" stands for \"manifest version.\" MV3 introduces a new type of runtime for Chrome extensions that, among other things, gets rid of\n          [0-35] code\n            [0-36] StaticText: webRequestBlocking\n          [0-37] StaticText: , a permission that allows extensions to block requests dynamically based on their content (which\n          [0-38] link: its replacement\n          [0-40] StaticText: does not support).

However, extensions are written in JavaScript, and the API functions they call look just like JavaScript functions, at least from the extension's point of view.

In theory, this should be safe.\n        [0-58] paragraph\n          [0-59] StaticText: But in the old days, Google decided it'd be a good idea to inject a bunch of JS files into pages that used Chrome APIs.

So how do you manipulate the properties of\n          [0-152] code\n            [0-153] StaticText: WebRequestEventImpl\n          [0-154] StaticText: to do anything interesting?\n        [0-155] paragraph\n          [0-156] StaticText: After a lot of time looking into the C++ code, I found exactly one vulnerable thing: the\n          [0-157] code\n            [0-158] StaticText: opt_webViewInstanceId\n          [0-159] StaticText: parameter. This was set for Chrome platform apps, in order to let them manage their embedded websites (WebViews). Among other things, it let them use web request blocking to control navigation. Basically, if an event had a WebView ID, the permission check for\n          [0-160] code\n            [0-161] StaticText: webRequestBlocking\n          [212] StaticText: \n          [0-162] link: would be skipped\n          [0-164] StaticText: . The issue was that the browser never verified that an event with a WebView ID actually belonged to a platform app. So an extension could spoof it, skip the check, and use the blocking feature.\n        [0-166] code\n          [0-167] StaticText: let WebRequestEvent = chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.constructor\n\n// opt_webViewInstanceId is the 5th argument\nlet fakeEvent = new WebRequestEvent(\"webRequest.onBeforeRequest\", 0, 0, 0, 1337)\n\nfakeEvent.addListener(() => {  \n    return { cancel: true }  \n}, { urls: ['*://*.example.com/*'] }, ['blocking'])\n        [0-168] paragraph\n          [0-169] StaticText: Maybe I should note that platform apps were\n          [0-170] strong\n            [0-171] StaticText: deprecated in 2020.\n          [0-172] StaticText: I found this bug in 2023, and the code to handle\n          [0-173] code\n            [0-174] StaticText: opt_webViewInstanceId\n          [0-175] StaticText: still exists in 2025. Goes to show how ancient code leads to bugs.\n        [0-176] heading: What could have happened, and what happened\n        [0-178] paragraph\n          [0-179] StaticText: Technically, someone could have used this bug to make a perfectly working adblocker in MV3 by simply replacing all instances of\n          [0-180] code\n            [0-181] StaticText: chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest\n          [0-182] StaticText: with\n          [0-183] code\n            [0-184] StaticText: fakeEvent\n          [0-185] StaticText: . This would have been very funny, after all the hype about how adblockers were being killed.\n        [0-186] paragraph\n          [0-187] StaticText: But I don't know how to make an adblocker, so I decided to\n          [0-188] link: report the issue to Google\n          [0-190] StaticText: in August 2023. It was patched in Chrome 118 by\n          [0-191] link: checking whether\n          [0-193] StaticText: extensions using\n          [0-194] code\n            [0-195] StaticText: opt_webViewInstanceId\n          [0-196] StaticText: actually had WebView permissions. For the report, I netted a massive reward of $0. They decided it wasn't a security issue, and honestly, I agree, because it didn't give extensions access to data they didn't already have.\n        [0-197] paragraph\n          [0-198] image: No money\n        [0-199] paragraph\n          [0-200] StaticText: (Shown above: my earnings from this bug.)\n        [0-201] paragraph\n          [0-202] StaticText: Anyway, it was a fun one, and it really shows how a few lines of code can sometimes bypass a big update by a big company.
